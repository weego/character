# character
Digital Music Instruments (DMIs) with Character. 
A Series with code examples in SuperCollider. 

-- work in progress -- 

## intro
Everyone wants to interact with a musical instrument that has *character*. There's tons of toys out there that ain't got any, and everyone is after those that do. 

This in an investigation into the quest of characterful instruments: what gives an instrument character and how can we achieve it in our own designs? 

The repo is structured in conceptual parts with reading suggestions, and SC code. 

## a few inspiration sources

### Bad behaviour - against engineering norms
- irregular sample rate 
- thermic drift
- aliasing 
- distorsion
- [low battery audio effects](https://nathan.ho.name/posts/low-battery-audio-effects/)
  
### inspired by organic life
- linear drift aka aging - reboot to get back
- mutation
  - start conditions mutate: Rand()
  - mapping hops - meta mapping 
  - stochastics

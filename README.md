# character
Digital Music Instruments (DMIs) with Character. 
A Series with code examples in SuperCollider. 

-- work in progress -- 

## intro
Everyone wants to play musical instruments that have *character*. There's tons of toys out there that ain't got any, and everyone is after those that do. 
But what is it that gives them *character*, and how can we achieve it in our own designs? 

The repo is structured in conceptual parts with reading material, and SC code. 

## methods

### *Bad behaviour* - against engineering norms
- thermic drift
- aliasing. e.g. [opal-rhythm-computor](https://blog.bela.io/2018/03/27/opal-rhythm-computor-dmx-krew/) emulation on Bela
- distorsion
- irregular sample rate 
- [low battery audio effects](https://nathan.ho.name/posts/low-battery-audio-effects/) / *power draining* in Circuit Bending
  
### inspired by organic life
- linear drift aka aging - reboot to get back. Barron's Synths. 
- mutation
  - start conditions mutate: Rand()
  - changing mapping - meta mapping 
    - SuperCollider [Influx](https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/Influx) library
    - Chikashi Myiama, Peacock 2009

`````
The mapping between outputs from the sensors and the parameters of the synthesizer gradually varies as the piece unfolds. Thus, an identical movement of hands produces completely different musical results in different sections of the piece.
